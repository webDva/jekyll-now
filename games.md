# *Ketchup and Raisins!: イケナイコト！*

A new game currently in the works. Web D.va's most ambitious one yet (hype)! [You can play it here](https://webdva.itch.io/ketchup-and-raisins).

# *I Hate Coffee: だめです！*

[You can play it here](https://webdva.github.io/I-Hate-Coffee-/public_html/).

# *Super Simple and Small 2D Platformer Game*

It *really* lags on mobile devices. [You can play it here](https://webdva.github.io/Super-Simple-and-Small-2D-Platformer-Game/public_html/index.html).

# *Pantsu Breakout Game*

My first ever web game made with Javascript. [You can play it here](https://webdva.github.io/Pantsu-Breakout-Game/public_html/).

# Other projects

I have many other things that I have made or started to make. There are interesting stories associated with these other projects, but I don't consider these other projects relevant enough to warrant listing them here. You can find some of these projects on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/webDva).
