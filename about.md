I'm a digital product maker. I'm resourceful, independent, and I create innovative solutions for unique problems. I have a passion for developing products and connecting them with business models. The overall goal, though, is to serve markets by delivering great value in order to obtain great returns.

# I can make web apps for you

I can use my skills and experience gained from making my own digital products to help you with realizing your own ideas and passions. You can contact me via [e-mail](mailto:webNoDva@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/webDva) to begin working with me.

## Services

If you're searching for someone to build a platform like Facebook for you, then my services will be of no use to you. But if you want help leveraging modern digital technology, then I would be delighted to be of service by making such technology for you!

âœ… **Apps that work:** help your business achieve more

âœ… **Minimal design:** simple and easy to use creations

âœ… **Advanced tech:** take advantage of the modern web

I provide free consultation that enables me to gather data that determines if we have values and merits that align with each other--and, of course, I would like to hear about your problems so that we can work together on solutions.

## Case studies coming soon!
