My name's Jermaine Easterling. I also use the psuedonym Web D.va, inspired by one of the waifus in my harem. Nonetheless, I am a confident and wholehearted individual with great charm, intelligence, and ambition.

At this early stage, it's hard to define me professionally. I can say, though, that I'm interested in science, technology, engineering, and math. I'm particularly interested in--and possibly developing an obsession for--machine learning. I'm also experienced with computing technology.

Personally, my other interests include succeeding at fitness and health, learning the Japanese language and culture, and being inspired by fiction and art.
