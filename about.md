My name's Jermaine Easterling. I also use the psuedonym Web D.va inspired by one of the waifus in my harem.

I write code and make video games, with goals to level up my web development skills and my computer science knowledge. Besides coding, my other interests are weightlifting, learning Japanese, and being inspired by fiction.
