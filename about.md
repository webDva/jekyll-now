My name's Jermaine Easterling. I also use the psuedonym Web D.va, inspired by one of the waifus in my harem.

I write code and make video games.

I mostly make my games as web games, benefitting from the convenience of HTML5. I have a bias toward things like Typescript and Phaser, because they make me more productive.

I'm also interested in machine learning and computer science stuff like algorithm analysis and data structures. It's important to understand the fundamentals of computer science in order to advance to the next level.

# The trendy, hip social section

I'm a big fan of weightlifting and healthy eating. It's so that I can become stronger than a hakaishin.

I also like learning the Japanese language.

And I like Dragonball Super, the Fate series, Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, the Witcher lore, Dark Souls and Bloodborne lore, and other things too!
