My name's Jermaine Easterling. I also use the psuedonym Web D.va, inspired by one of the waifus in my harem. Nonetheless, I am a confident and wholehearted individual with great charm, intelligence, and ambition. I write code, make video games, and realize ideas. Besides coding, my other interests include succeeding at fitness and health, learning the Japanese language and culture, and being inspired by fiction and art.
