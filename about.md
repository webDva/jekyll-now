My name's Jermaine Easterling. I also use the psuedonym *Web D.va*, inspired by one of the waifus in my harem. Nonetheless, I am a wholehearted and confident individual with great charm, intelligence, and ambition.

My objective is to obtain advanced skills and knowledge in data science. To accomplish that, I choose to engage in a long campaign of learning and practice. I'll be hustling and grinding a lot--and that's okay!

I'm also experienced with computing technology and you can thus define me as a software engineer with a bias toward producing lots of value. I've been learning web development since the beginning of 2017.

I used to make video games (my data science education is taking its place) and my last two video games, *I Hate Coffee: だめです！* and *Super Simple and Small 2D Platformer Game*, can be found [here](https://webdva.github.io/I-Hate-Coffee-/public_html/) and [here](https://webdva.github.io/Super-Simple-and-Small-2D-Platformer-Game/public_html/index.html).

Personally and social-wise (and for maintaining a typical work-life balance), my other interests include excelling at fitness and health, learning the Japanese language and culture, and being inspired by fiction and art.

Great, I'm starting to sound typical, trendy, and therefore, hip--what have I become!
