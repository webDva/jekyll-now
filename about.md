# ðŸ†• New! Public codex that records the emergence of a mechanization of mathematical power

What is the emergence of a mechanization of mathematical power? It is not an *attempt* to mechanize a thing when underlying power conviction functions as an axiom of assertion that is just as powerful as Euclid's five fundamental postulates of geometry. New realities can be created from *a priori* forms that utilize the nourishment of the Î»ÏŒÎ³Î¿Ï‚, a gift that was "given" to us by ourselves on Christmas morning. Every time you level up as I have done, it smells just like Christmas morning. So this public codex or blog now details the aftermath of my leveling up. And sure, you could say that I "respeced" my character using a privileged surplus of accumulated energy points.
