I'm *webdva*.

I'm resourceful, independent, and I create innovative solutions for unique problems. I have a passion for developing digital products and connecting them with business models. The overall goal, though, is to serve markets by delivering great value in order to obtain great returns.

I maintain a weekly [blog](/blog/) where I be *very* poetic and *extremely* transparent.

I also provide entertainment for people by making video games--which you can play by heading to the [games](/games/) section!

# Who am I as a software developer?

When it comes to making software, I have one year of experience with web development. Javascript (ES6 and Typescript too), HTML5, and CSS3. I also use modern Angular. I write Node.js and Express.js code to create server backends that usually live on Heroku. I do have familiarity with Python and Java, and I should probably use Python more when making products that use machine learning.

Due to my studies of years past, I'm also familiar with computing architecture, such as how and why processor level instructions work. That low level machine language understanding really *does* help with developing software. So, yes, I have experience with archaic science and technology, although that experience seems to be fading.

I may not have a formal degree, but I am developing my capabilities in computer science, mostly with machine learning. Especially since the markets call for it, as a tech entrepreneur must do anything to discover new markets in order to reap the benefits of serving them.

# Independent digital product maker

Speaking of markets, I've acquired knowledge in economics and business, especially as I'm an independent digital product maker.

Ah, yes, economics. The thing that matters more to me.

My process involves rushing to create an Initial Product Release (IPR) that arrives on the markets, letting the world know that it exists.

Next, I iterate on the product or productized service, creating a greater version that I can deem as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

A long, sustained campaign of promotion and increasing market share follows, so that great returns on investment can be made. Once a substantial change in the market has occurred, I will then have succeeded in gaining Minimum Viable Traction (MVT) whose success can be enumerated to yield even greater returns. For instance, I'm currently trying to gain traction with my [Baka Youtube Downloader](https://www.bakayoutube.com).

No market validation needed, because I'm *pretty sure* that I'm discovering new and unknown markets.
