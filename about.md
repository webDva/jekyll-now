I'm Jermaine Easterling, or *webdva*, and I'm a technology person.

I'm resourceful, independent, and I create innovative solutions for unique problems. I have a passion for developing digital products and connecting them with business models. The overall goal, though, is to serve markets by delivering great value in order to obtain great returns.

I maintain a weekly [blog](/blog/) where I be *very* poetic and *extremely* transparent.

I also provide entertainment for people by making video games--which you can play by heading to the [games](/games/) section!

## Technical skills

When it comes to making software, I have one year of experience with web development. Javascript (ES6 and Typescript too), HTML5, and CSS3. I also use modern Angular.

I write Node.js and Express.js code to create server backends. I do have familiarity with Python and Java, and I should probably use Python more when making products that use machine learning.

## Business skills

As an independent digital product maker, I've acquired knowledge in economics and business.

My process involves rushing to create an Initial Product Release (IPR) that arrives on the markets, letting the world know that it exists.

Next, I iterate on the product or productized service, creating a greater version that I can deem as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

A long, sustained campaign of promotion and increasing market share follows, so that great returns on investment can be made. Once a substantial change in the market has occurred, I will then have succeeded in gaining Minimum Viable Traction (MVT) whose success can be enumerated to yield even greater returns.

No market validation whatsoever. After all, who knows better than the entrepreneur that nurtures the market?
