My name's Jermaine Easterling. I also use the psuedonym Web D.va, inspired by one of the waifus in my harem.

I write code and make video games.

I mostly make my games as web games, benefitting from the convenience of HTML5. I have a bias toward things like Typescript and Phaser.

I also like to devote my time to understanding machine learning and other computer science stuff like algorithms and data structures.

# The trendy, hip social section

I'm a big fan of weightlifting and healthy eating. It's so that I can become stronger than a hakaishin.

I also like learning the Japanese language.

And I like Dragonball Super, the Fate series, Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, the Witcher lore, Dark Souls and Bloodborne lore, and other things too!
