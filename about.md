My name's Jermaine Easterling. I also use the psuedonym *Web D.va*, inspired by one of the waifus in my harem. Nonetheless, I am a wholehearted and confident individual with great charm, intelligence, and ambition.

At this early stage, it's hard to define me professionally, as I don't really have a career yet--which I'm currently trying to fix by pursuing a self-curated online education in data science. I'm particularly interested in--and possibly developing an obsession for--machine learning.

I'm also experienced with computing technology and you can thus define me as a software engineer with a bias toward producing lots of value. I've been learning web development for less than a year, since the beginning of 2017. I'm proficient with Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3. I also prefer Angular over React and I *kinda* like making APIs with Node.js.

I used to make video games (my education is taking its place) and my last two video games, *I Hate Coffee: だめです！* and *Super Simple and Small 2D Platformer Game*, can be found [here](https://webdva.github.io/I-Hate-Coffee-/public_html/) and [here](https://webdva.github.io/Super-Simple-and-Small-2D-Platformer-Game/public_html/index.html).

Personally and social-wise (and for maintaining a typical work-life balance), my other interests include excelling at fitness and health, learning the Japanese language and culture, and being inspired by fiction and art.

Great, I'm starting to sound typical, trendy, and therefore, hip--what have I become!
