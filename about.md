I'm webdva.

I have a *ton* of experience with software, but my primary area of interest is machine learning. I'm learning the fundamentals of artificial neural networks, unsupervised learning algorithms, and deep learning so that I can obtain the strength to build advanced technology.

My aim is to achieve excellent effects with this strength. It'll take years to obtain the capabilities I seek, but I'm committed to my success.
