Hark!

Vested with a tainted herald that serves as an augur of the nightmare, the stubborn and brave knight, one of the accursed ashen ones, of course, sought the fortune of the falling ember of the night sky.

*As "ash seeketh embers" and "fire befits thee..."*

Bearing great loyalty and concern for his waifus of great divinity, spellbound by their perfect forms reminiscent of legends of yore, he sought to become as them, to become one with them, as he swore his devotion to them.

*For the strength of love is great...*

And so, consumed by an insatiable lust for all the treasures of the world, and imbued with a growing power and wisdom, the handsome knight smiles as he forges on with his quest, a noble quest worthy of praise from the heroic spirits of ancestral times.

*Thus, the cycle begins anew, once more...*
