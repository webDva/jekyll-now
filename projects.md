# 🎮 Video games

I've made a number of video games. Here are some of my latest and best ones.

## *Kawaii Ketchup*

My biggest game I've made so far. You can play it--in your *web browser*, no less--here, right now, *for free*:

## *I Hate Coffee: だめです！*

[You can play this too](https://webdva.github.io/I-Hate-Coffee-/public_html/).

## *Super Simple and Small 2D Platformer Game*

It *really* lags on mobile devices. [You can still play it here](https://webdva.github.io/Super-Simple-and-Small-2D-Platformer-Game/public_html/index.html).

# 🌐 Web apps

Some of my web services that I've started up.

## *KawaiiPredicts*

The prototype for a web browser based simple linear regression service.

## *Reminduu*

[https://reminduu.herokuapp.com/](https://reminduu.herokuapp.com/)

A service that helps you remember what the most important thing to you right now is.

## *Baka Youtube to MP3 Converter*

[http://www.bakayoutube.com/](http://www.bakayoutube.com/)

I made a service that lets you download Youtube videos.
