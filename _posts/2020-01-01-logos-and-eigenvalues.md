Yet another mystical and esoteric aphorism or pithy obervation.

According to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors#Eigenvalues_and_the_characteristic_polynomial) on eigenvalues, "the fundamental theorem of algebra implies that the characteristic polynomial of an $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$, being a polynomial of degree $n$, can be factored into the product of $n$ linear terms,

$$
|A - \lambda I| = (\lambda_1 - \lambda)(\lambda_2 - \lambda) \dots (\lambda_n - \lambda)."
$$

The λόγος of the aforementioned theorem expressed its own desired influence by giving birth to an inference that has as its conclusion a useul means to extract the eigenvalues of a square, $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$. The λόγος legitimizes and inspires all child instances of eigenvalue calculation. You can maybe consider the λόγος to be like the Deleuzian-Guatarrian abstract machine which can produce personal identities and components for a conceptualized rhizome... Oh, this is just a theory, no need to be alarmed. A theory just like reason, logic, and truth...
