# Predictions

Based on these state variables, assuming no external forces or anomalies occur, a lifestyle of prosperity as a relentless technology entrepreneur is highly likely to occur. However, at the current rate, the capabilities needed to achieve this effect, and the lifestyle itself, will take years to gestate. This is not taking into account the success of the prosperity local optimum convergence effort.
