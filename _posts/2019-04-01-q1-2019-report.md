The report for the first quarter of the year 2019.

# Game development effects and achievements

I further improved my 3D modeling abilities.

I further improved my 3D animation abilities.

I [achieved](/how-i-implemented-client-side-linear-interpolation/) an implementation of client-side linear interpolation combined with client-side prediction for a networked multiplayer game.

I gained the capability to create and use shaders. I published a [reference](/a-very-brief-introduction-to-the-construction-of-shaders/) for constructing shaders.

I achieved collision detection for a networked multiplayer 3D game.

# Product development

I began development of a 3D multiplayer browser game that went through many iterations.

It first looked like this, a game with RPG combat:

And then it looked like this, an innovative pseudo-massive multiplayer flying shooter game idea:

# Engineering and scientific capabilities gained

* I achieved the implementation for a conditional front-end browser source code minification system.
* I learned the concept of affine transformations for 3D game development, including movement along a forward facing vector and position translations in three dimensional space.
* I gained the capability to achieve rotations in three dimensional space for a 3D game, involving the knowledge of Euler angles and rotation matrices.
* I gained an understanding of quaternions.
* I learned new mathematical concepts such as the hyperplane separation theorem for implementing collision detection with oriented bounded boxes in three dimensions.

# Strategic commercial activities

* I planned to enter the modern browser game market space to obtain a portion of that market share in an effort to accomplish the Prosperity program's goal of establishing income as a technology entrepreneur before the year 2020.

* I failed to achieve the Initial Product Release of a 3D multiplayer browser game before the end of the quarter.

* I considered a pivot from the business-to-consumer segment of game development due to a possible lack of founder-customer fit. Due to a set of cognitive biases and distortions, I actually may have been mistaken about the value of such consumer markets to me as an entrepreneur.

# Personal aspects/Operating agent status

* I discovered and adopted the utility of eternal optimism. I now bear all the utilities needed to meet the requirements for having the right stuff.

# Summary of the quarter

I worked on the development of a 3D multiplayer browser game and obtained very useful capabilities. I am now in possession of more advanced technology, knowledge, and processes than what was had in the previous quarter ([Q4 2018](/2018-q4-report/)).

# Predictions

## Short term

With a great commitment to the Prosperity program and to doing the right thing, the Prosperity program's success will be achieved, which is, ultimately, the convergence to a local optimum of prosperity.

## The far future

Greater courage, integrity, commitment, and other treasures will be obtained. Greater nondominated solutions will be converged to and lesser dominated states diverged from.

With the predicted post-Prosperity assets and capital that will be obtained, I will be able to eventually establish a far-reaching enterprise that engages in experimental physics and mend the world in innovative ways.
