title: "Sell, sell, sell: my ambition is the greatest of all"

"Fear is the disease and [cold calling one hundred people] is the antidote." I must have the courage to grind for a high number of outbound sales as though I were grinding for [Abyss Points in Aion](http://aion.wikia.com/wiki/Abyss_Point).

I needn't follow the path of others especially as I've my own unique conditions. I resourcefully leverage the Twitter platform to perform my hypothetical cold calls and this may actually yield an advantage. Regardless, my conditions and circumstances have led me here, being resourceful in such a manner as this.

Not only am I an engineer, I am also a salesman.
