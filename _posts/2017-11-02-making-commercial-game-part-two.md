title: "Making a Commercial Game! Part Two: Iteration and Enumeration of the Initial Minimal Draft!"
summary: "Game development is like writing. It's important to come up with an initial minimal draft for an idea as soon as possible."

After two hours of working on the game, I came up with an initial minimal draft of the gameplay. You can see it in action here.

I had the red block objects (which will become ketchup bottles in future iterations) initially function as homing missiles that follow the player, but I couldn't create an elaborate homing missile object. There's still a chance to add such a feature later in the game though. For now, the ketchup bottles will just be moved toward to the player for the gameplay. I plan to add noise such as having varying travel speeds and launch times and elaborate travel patterns. I also plan to create hip animations for the ketchup bottles.

As part of the gameplay, I'll have the player collecting raisins while they try to dodge the incoming ketchup bottles. A new pitch for the game could then be: "dodge ketchup bottles while collecting raisins." That's the name of the game, too, *Ketchup and Raisins? イケナイコト！*. I'll also include a time elapsed and raisins collected score metric for the gameplay.

Now that I've made initial progress, I can better estimate the future, albeit slightly. I plan to devote 1,000 hours total to making the game with 60 hour work weeks, which would mean four months of development time. That seems like a standard and typical software development campaign effort. I hope it doesn't take something like 2,500 hours, which would be nine months of development time instead.

It's like leveling up a new character in an MMORPG game with beneficial goals and actions having costs associated with them. Rather than paying the cost of performing five mundane virtual tasks for obtaining a specific reward in an MMORPG game, I will instead be using my time to make parts of the game for the reward of a good, completed game. Playing an MMORPG game for 1,000 to 2,500 hours to level up a character compared to making a game for 1,000 and 2,500 hours seems about right.

Generally, the more time spent, the better the rewards. So that means that I'll devote a lot of time to making this game, unlike my previous games!
