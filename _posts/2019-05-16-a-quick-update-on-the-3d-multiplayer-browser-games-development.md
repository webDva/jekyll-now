title: A quick update on the 3D multiplayer browser game's development
---

In addition to doing extensive game design, I've been doing game development as I must perform many tasks myself.

# Nonplayer characters

I made progress on the main aspects of the nonplayer characters (NPCs), such as how they behave.

If I keep this up, working on such a thing as NPC behavior, then I'll be able to employ real artificial intelligence (or machine learning) for such a game product. Because, let's not forget that this program, this effort, is an investment in the future and in future capabilities, in addition to its noble goal of facilitating convergence to a local optimum of prosperity before this decade is out.

The NPCs are, like, *really* at the center of this game idea. Even though it's a multiplayer game--and *because* it's a multiplayer game with a particular goal which involves having acceptable user retention among others. Let's just say that I don't intend to make the same mistake with such things that developers of multiplayer games often do.

# An archer class and unexpected complexity

I made an archer class to go alongside the warrior and mage classes.

In the above screenshot, the archer's attack fails to damage one of the targets. The archer's attack failure may be because of the low update rate of the game combined with the high speed of the archer's projectile attack. And so, high speed attacks are prohibited for the current configuration and design.

Thanks to this recent experience, I have discovered, firsthand, that the development of a multiplayer game that uses action combat is much more complex, difficult, and expensive than the development of a multiplayer game that uses tab targeting like most MMORPGs. So this game won't be an action RPG game.

So these recent achievements seem to be prototypes for the final design.

# An Entity-Component System

When I originally started up this 3D multiplayer game, I chose the specification of forbidding myself from using an Entity-Component System. The reason was that I wanted this game product to be simple enough to not warrant the need for an Entity-Component System.

But here I am, creating such a thing, which was unexpected.

# Socioeconomic aspects

This product I'm making isn't entirely a technological endeavor because it's a game with the requirement to satisfy a certain type of market's demand. Nonetheless, I will ultimately succeed, before this decade is out, in making this product and establish revenue with the achievement of product-market fit.

Furthermore, this development log isn't really a high utility factor as my likely and true target audience for this product doesn't even consume such content. It would be a negative utility factor to rely on this blog/codex for marketing this product. As such, I'm going to decrease the amount of these development updates so that I can devote more effort to the product's success.

Now, I currently have two great problems to solve.

As I am, first and foremost, an entrepreneur who treads an extraordinary path with a powerful mind and will, whom (as in what market) should I serve? And what (as in what game product) should I make for them?
