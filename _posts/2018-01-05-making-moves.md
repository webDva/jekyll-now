This week, Webdva makes progress in learning to focus while being committed to exerting great effort consistently.

# A main menu for *Kawaii Ketchup*

Even though [*Kawaii Ketchup*](https://webdva.itch.io/kawaii-ketchup) can be played on mobile devices, it lags heavily on them. But that's alright, because for this operation, the mobile platform is unnecessary as I choose to focus on and target desktop devices. I believe that I'm making a good move by doing the equivalent of not trying to scale something that may not even gain traction.

Anyway, here's the main menu I added which hypes up the atmosphere of the game!

I've also added music and properly attributed the source of it in the credits sub-menu.

I should be--and I am, in fact--very proud of the achievement of having went from this:

to this, in the span of two months time:

My game development prowess is increasing and I noticed that the longer I work on a project, the more time I have to grow it, adding features to it and polishing it.

*Duh, Dva!*

# SSL and migrating hosts

I don't like namecheap.com's unkind business model of up-selling, requiring you to additionally pay for an SSL certificate.

Nonetheless, I still believe in *Reminduu* and thus decide to pay for an SSL certificate. I'm in a state of negative cash flow anyway, so that's normal anyway.

--Is what I would've said if I didn't find out how to get a free SSL certificate!

Next, I migrated [*Reminduu*](http://www.reminduu.com) away from being hosted on GitHub Pages to Heroku so that I can install my new SSL certificate and then later, use Node.js to bring out the big features planned for *Reminduu*.

# Hunting for motivation

I believe that--I know that data science expertise and usage can help with things like developing capabilities for space travel. I came up with that idea while searching for motivation to endure this ten or twenty year process of securing my spot in the global economy.

*A fantasy, where, in the future, I tell to others a tale of how I used to make and sell web games for a living and then I began a career of earning billions of dollars with creating hyper-advanced artificial intelligence technology.*

Oh, and I have $0 of income right now, so that's, like, a *big* motivation.

# The cost of failure
    
A daydream, where my potential future employer and I would make such a great team as I would deliver magnitudes of value for them while they compensate me for it and support me with decent and compassionate leadership--but, that's believing that we would be great matches for each other in the first place and that we are able to find each other, probabilities that I am very pessimistic about.

So, I continue on with my campaign of self-employment and entrepreneurship with not wanting to deal with the negative consequences of failing acting as one of my motivations.

*Yes, running toward something as well as away from something.*

# Inspiration borne from another tongue

I learned the Japanese word 努める（つとめる）(*tsutomeru*) which means *to be committed (to doing something)*.

I must be like that as this trek is the best option for me. I must not let dark realities stop me as I display my commitment to exerting great effort consistently.

Focus, as well as commitment.

I also learned the Japanese word 進歩（しんぽ）(*shinpo*) which means *progress*, *advance*, *improvement*, or *development*.

If only I could measure my progress so that I could see it. That would inspire me to forge on even more maybe.

Nonetheless, I am aware that I am making progress, even if it's a wee bit, that's greater than zero--a number that seems to be a common antagonist in my story.
