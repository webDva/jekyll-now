title: A positive report on recent activities

I'm doing a startup. I'm trying to change the world.

And an understanding of these arcane arts will help me realize that ambition.

It's not rocket science. 3D multiplayer game development isn't rocket science. It's a subset of rocket science.

I needn't concern myself with the ability to implement a hydrazine fuel powered thrust subsystem for a spacecraft and its interaction with other elements of the super system that it's part of. But I do need to be aware of such things as how to minimize the time to Initial Product Release for my startup product I'm making under great constraints.

I'm pretty hardcore. I'm a pretty hardcore entrepreneur.

# What I've been up to

![3D space movement](/assets/images/3d_movement_progress.gif "Making a server-side 3D multiplayer game engine.")

I began learning how to do orientations and rotations in three dimensions (even though I [remarked](/a-consideration-on-server-side-physics-for-a-3d-multiplayer-game-regarding-rotations-in-3d-space/) about such a thing). I want to make a game where the player call roll, pitch, and yaw. That's one of my tasks right now, learning how to achieve that effect.

I know more about doing 3D transformations now. Model views, translations, and pre and post multiplications.

I created software technology (i.e., I wrote source code) for creating rotation matrices from Euler angles. I'm learning quaternions now. I think primarily using quaternions for orientations and rotations will be better for this new small and simple 3D multiplayer game engine/system I'm making. And I totally did not expect to make such a thing.

# Forget not integrity

All this stuff I'm doing is experience for me. Experience that will define a future agent of great worth and constitution.

# Forget not courage

The ambition to endure this trying entrepreneurial process is a required positive utility factor for success.

# And forget not commitment

All this experience I'm gaining, all these deeds I'm doing, is for the sake of the future.

Because I'm committed to engineering the future.
