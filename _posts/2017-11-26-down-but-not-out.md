If this was an RPG, I would be a great character!

I'm not sure about this being a nightmare. But whatever it is, I must decide to believe that I will persist and then take action to transcending the nightmare, to seek strength.

If I do not believe that I will persist, then I surely will not escape the nightmare.

*I have to keep walking forward,*

*covered in darkness,*

*toward that glowing treasure,*

*past the sorrow that blocks me.*

*And if I fall, then I'll just get back up.*

No matter what trials I may face, my devotion to getting what I want will never falter.

# On a lighter note!

I created running animations for the player avatar. The latest version is up [here](https://webdva.itch.io/ketchup-and-raisins) on my itchi.io.

I have a list of things to do for the game, things to add, things to change, more to come!

Here's a .gif of the latest iteration of the game showing the running animation!
