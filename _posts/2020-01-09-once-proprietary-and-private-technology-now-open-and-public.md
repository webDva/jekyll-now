I open sourced the 3D multiplayer browser game.

So if you ever wanted to know what all the internals of the 3D multiplayer browser game I was making looked like, this is your opportunity to see! I guess I'm a real typical startup founder now where I decide to pivot and give away ownership from a failed endeavor. This particular video game product went through many changes, like it was supposed to, but all for the final end and show (a spectacle!) of unfavorable action. For no revenue was obtained—the achievement of revenue, the goal of the business—before the time limit was reached. Nonetheless, the profound technology entrepreneurship experience was essential and it will come in handy in future conquests and successes.
