title: An Aphorism on Partitions Found in Riemann Integrals
use_math: true
---

In preparation for the construction of automatics, here lies a short or quick conceptualization of a particular nature or aspect of the partitions of Riemann integrals.

Suppose the elements $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. A *partition* of the interval $[a, b]$ is a finite list of the form $x_0, x_1, \dots , x_n$, where 

$$
a = x_0 < x_1 < \dots < x_n = b.
$$

The interval $[a, b]$ as a union

$$
[a, b] = [x_0, x_1] \cup [x_1, x_2] \cup \dots \cup [x_{n-1}, x_n]
$$

possibly shows that the choice of $x_i^{\ast}$ in the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ is arbitrary when calculating Riemann sums

$$
S = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i^{\ast} \Delta{x_i}
$$

over interval with partition. This is maybe less evident when the partition $x_0, x_1, \dots , x_n$ is instead thought of as a set

$$
P = \{ [x_0, x_1], [x_1, x_2], \dots, [x_{n-1}, x_n] \},
$$

because of the lack of the set union denotation. The *whatness* of $a$ and $b$ need not be members of $\mathbb{R}$, as, ultimately, any determination of *being* or distinction requires synthesized understanding and not any understanding given *a priori*.â€”So the internal composition of $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$, influenced by what $[a, b]$ is, is possibly a dynamic and constantly in flux interaction between the choices of, now contingent, elements contained in the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$. This aphorism is really, then, my official or so break or departure from traditional mathematical Platonism of the static *a priori* kind and a demonstration and exercise of my own particular brand of inverted Platonism. No more "givens" or static *a priori*s: a very dangerous renouncement of truth... May it and the ensuing chaos be the powerful inspiration of great fulfillment.

...This feeling of power... So this is the power of the willful synthetic a priori judgment. If you're curious to know more, dear reader, see aphorism number eleven in Friedrich Nietzsche's *Beyond Good and Evil* philosophical tome.
