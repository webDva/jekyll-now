title: A Day of Courage
---

Let this day be a day of courage. And may all the other ones be so as well.

We must have the courage to do the right thing. The courage to do all that is necessary to achieve our goals. This is so that we may engineer a future of prosperity as that is one of our ambitions. We must also be forever committed to doing the right thing lest we are not committed.

You can't always get what you want if you do not have the means and the desire to get what you want.

Then let us have the ambition and the strength to get what we want. If we must plead with our hearts within so that strength may be granted then may we do so.
