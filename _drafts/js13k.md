# What hapens now

Good news, though!

I have a partially completed game now! So that means that I can recycle the idea for making new games, which is part of my strategy for coming up with game ideas.

In fact, I have a new goal: to quickly prototype a simple and small game and then work on it for a month or three and polish it completely. Fortunately, I've already started on the game and [you can see my progress here](https://github.com/webDva/Pantsu-Sweeper). This will be the first game that I work on for more than a few months, I think.
